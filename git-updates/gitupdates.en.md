# Gitupdates 

Gitupdates is an idea for a web app (or desktop plugin) that notifies you when your repository is starred or when an issue is filed and all things about your repository.
while yes you could actually open up the website HAH who does that!?

## login plans

I don't think there should be a login though there are some holes in that. You can just look up a repository and see its star/issue/pull request history.
however if I do utilize logins with MySql then I could have a custom repo tracker- view any repo's history of pull requests and issues with just one click.
however even better if I login with github, all you have to do is star a repository and it'll show up in your git tracker. Just a thought.

## UI plans

I really want this to be a fully fleshed-out web app so I'll discuss the UI and CSS plans here for future reference. I was thinking the UI would be something like gitter but I'll
be fresh and original and maybe try a lighter theme. I love the color Chartreuse and I know green goes great with orange or blue so I'll think about that later because I can't 
decide now.

## and yeah that's it!
