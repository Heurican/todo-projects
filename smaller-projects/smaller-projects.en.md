# Here's a list of smaller projects I haven't fully fleshed out yet.

### #1: A bitcoin fork.

### #2: A hacked minecraft client.

### #3: A PIL project- video matting, image recognition or something like that. 
maybe I'll even make a folder for this.

### #4: A better discord bot.
possible folder coming for this one as well.

### #5: A python machine learning project.
